@1:36 6/7/20 after stumbling to recall how to get maneuver both GIT and the console. I have accomplished the following.
Created an THE_ODIN_PROJECT folder for the start of this long journey.
Created a GOOGLE-HOMPAGE repository on GitHub and have succesffuly cloned it locally (there was nothing there).
Created a README.md to help catelog this journey.
Created an Index.html file.
Within the INDEX.HTML file. created a BODY, Header and Footer.
Started working on the "image" of google

::Description of the google page::
Top Left (an "about" link and the immediate right is a "store" link)
Top Right (a "Gmail" link; "Images" link; "Google Apps" and a "profile pick)

Center of page: GOOGLE logo and beneath that a search bar; Below that are 2 buttons "Google Search" and "I'm Feeling Lucky"

Bottom Left ("Advertising" link; "Business" link; "How Search works")
Bottom Right ("Privacy" link; "Terms" link; "Settings" link)

Created NAV tags for both header and Footer for the links
--going to pause on this project and replicate another-- Cirlce back if that fails..
