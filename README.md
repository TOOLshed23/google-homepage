@1:36 6/7/20 after stumbling to recall how to get maneuver both GIT and the console. I have accomplished the following.
Created an THE_ODIN_PROJECT folder for the start of this long journey.
Created a GOOGLE-HOMPAGE repository on GitHub and have succesffuly cloned it locally (there was nothing there).
Created a README.md to help catelog this journey.
Created an Index.html file.
Within the INDEX.HTML file. created a BODY, Header and Footer.
Started working on the "image" of google

::Description of the google page::
Top Left (an "about" link and the immediate right is a "store" link)
Top Right (a "Gmail" link; "Images" link; "Google Apps" and a "profile pick)

Center of page: GOOGLE logo and beneath that a search bar; Below that are 2 buttons "Google Search" and "I'm Feeling Lucky"

Bottom Left ("Advertising" link; "Business" link; "How Search works")
Bottom Right ("Privacy" link; "Terms" link; "Settings" link)

Created NAV tags for both header and Footer for the links
--going to pause on this project and replicate another-- Cirlce back if that fails.. 
see notes on other project....
--i added all the links that is on the Google Hompage
linked the google image to the center of page; need to position to the middle.
**NOTES to look into and avoid**CSS GRID (leave relative and absolute) 

Was able to get the logo centered (not in the center of the page) and was able to move the links to the left and right bottom and top accordingly. Still need to fine tune their exact position.

Created both an input, as well as the 2 buttons beneath the "google" image.
